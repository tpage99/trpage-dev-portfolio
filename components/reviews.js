        <p className="text-xl md:text-3xl font-light italic pb-4 text-gray-600">Taylor Page stepped up to the plate when my team was maxed out big time! My client had 2 very specific coding requests for their Shopify store and within no time Taylor assessed the requirements and implemented a solution with no hesitation. He was able to explain the solution to me in a way which my non-technical-founder-mind could easily grasp. I will continue to utilize Taylor's development skills for Shopify projects going forward because of his familiarity with the platform and his sharp coding skills. If you're looking for a web developer for any platform, you NEED to touch base with Taylor first.</p>

        <p className="text-xl md:text-3xl font-light italic pb-4 text-gray-600">TR Page is the best Shopify expert I’ve interacted with. At first I was hesitant to work with him as there were no reviews, but I quickly learned that was not for a lack of experience, skill, or helpfulness. He absolutely went above and beyond to knock the job out of the park (our website now runs faster than I thought possible, nearly 3x the original speed). The price he charged was more than reasonable, and the biggest highlight for me was the clear and open communication throughout the process. I plan to return to TR Page with all of my web development needs in the future, I can’t recommend him highly enough.</p>

        <p className="text-xl md:text-3xl font-light italic pb-4 text-gray-600">We were needing help starting our first Shopify site (Navigation, Apps, Coding, Layout) and Taylor reached out to my request. Right away, I knew we wanted to work with Taylor...During the entire process, Taylor was very accommodating (we had many little things pop up that he was quick to address) and had great communication. We really liked that he was eager to dive into our project and was always open to having a video conference to better understand what we needed. He also understood our vision, by asking us questions and getting a better understanding of out point of view, which we really appreciated! All in all, we are extremely happy that we went with Taylor and we highly recommend his services!</p>

        <p className="text-xl md:text-3xl font-light italic pb-4 text-gray-600">We have worked with Taylor 3 times now, I have been impressed with Taylor's communication before and through out the project's Taylor's work was spot on, with delivery and implemantion. Our first incounter was after 2 unsuccessful attempts from different developers to restore and implement our custom collections pages after a Shopify update, Taylor was able to crack the code where others failed. Taylor went above and beyond the scope of works. I would recommend Taylor and definitely work with him again. I am all ready look for more work in the next few months with all the changes that Shopify will have coming up in the change over to 2.0.</p>
